# MNIST Digit Predictor

This repository contains a project for predicting handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to train a model that can accurately classify digits from 0 to 9.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
- Builds and trains a neural network model for digit recognition
- Evaluates the model on test data
- Provides prediction for new, user-supplied images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
